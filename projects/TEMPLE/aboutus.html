                        to Lord
                        Narasimha Swamy, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. The temple name is derived from "Simha"- a lion
                        and "Achala"- a hill</p>
                    <p class="p2">
                        The deity is in the tribhangi posture, with the head of a lion on a human torso. The temple has
                        16-pillared Natyamandapa and 96-pillared Kalyanamandapa. The idol is covered with sandalwood
                        throughout the year and is revealed only once a year which is celebrated as Chandanotsavam

                    <h3>The Legend of Prahalad</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hiranyakasipu, to avenge the death of his brother Hiranyaksha, performed austerities to seek
                        immortality from Lord Brahma. Lord Brahma grants him a boon that he could not be killed by
                        animals or man. Hiranyakasipu then starts troubling gods, sages, and worshipers of Lord Vishnu
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hiranyakasipu's son Prahalad was a devotee of Lord Vishnu. Angered by Prahalad's devotion,
                        Hiranyakasipu orders his servants to drown his son in the sea and place mount Simhadri over him.
                        However, Lord Narayana rescues Prahalada and places Simhadri at the rescue site. Lord Narasimha
                        kills Hiranyakasipu, after which Prahalad builts Simhachalam Temple</p>

                    Legend has it that Pururava, and his wife Urvasi, were drawn to Simhachalam. That is when they
                    discover the ancient shrine in ruins after many centuries. They rescue the deity and cover it with
                    sandal paste after they receive a message from heaven. According to the message, the Lord is only to
                    be worshipped in this form and the original form should only be revealed once per year. The temple
                    was reconstructed and has remained ever since
