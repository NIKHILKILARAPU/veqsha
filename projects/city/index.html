                    Sankranti, Ugadi, Dussehra, and Deepavali are celebrated with joy, traditional rituals, and colorful
                    gatherings that reflect the deep cultural roots of the region. Temples around the city—such as the
                    famous Sanivarapupeta temples—stand as symbols of faith and age-old artistry.

                    What makes Eluru truly special is the warmth of its people. Community bonds are strong, and

                <h1>Festivals</h1>
                <p>Ganganamma Jatara is a deeply revered festival celebrated with immense devotion in many villages
                    across Andhra Pradesh. Dedicated to Goddess Ganganamma, who is worshipped as the guardian and
                    protector of the community, this jatara reflects the emotional connection people share with their
                    local deities. The festival usually takes place once a year, and preparations begin weeks in advance
                    as villagers clean the temple surroundings, decorate the streets, and organize cultural programs to
                    honor their goddess.

                    The heart of the jatara lies in its traditional rituals, many of which have been followed for
                    generations. Devotees offer coconuts, turmeric, kumkum, neem leaves, and specially prepared prasadam
                    to Goddess Ganganamma, believing that she protects their village from diseases, calamities, and
                    negative energies. Some villages also perform special poojas like Pallaki Seva, Bonalu, or Ammavari
                    Alankaram, where the goddess is beautifully decorated with flowers, silks, and ornaments. These
                    rituals create an atmosphere filled with devotion, chanting, and spiritual energy.

                    Along with religious practices, the jatara stands out for its colorful cultural traditions. Folk
                    dancers, drummers, and local artists participate enthusiastically, creating a festive mood
                    throughout the celebrations. Traditional forms like Teenmaar, Dappu Nrityam, and Haridasu
                    performances bring back the essence of rural art. Many people who live in towns and cities return to
                    their native village during the jatara, making it a reunion of families, relatives, and old friends.
                    This adds a warm emotional touch to the festival.

                    One of the major attractions of Ganganamma Jatara is the vibrant fair (shandy) set up near the
                    temple. The entire area turns lively with stalls selling toys, eateries offering local snacks,
                    traditional bangles, handicrafts, and more. Children enjoy the rides and games, while elders indulge
                    in shopping and meeting people. This fair becomes a symbol of social bonding, economic activity, and
                    collective celebration.

                    As night falls, the jatara becomes even more mesmerizing with lights, devotional songs, and cultural
                    performances. The sight of thousands of devotees gathered with faith, hope, and joy creates a
                    powerful and unforgettable experience. For many villagers, Ganganamma Jatara is not just a festival
                    — it is a symbol of unity, tradition, gratitude, and the divine presence that watches over their
                    community.</p>
